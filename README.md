==========================

Read Ilya Grigoriks [post](http://www.igvita.com/2009/12/22/ruby-websockets-tcp-for-the-browser/)
about WebSocket and Ruby Eventmachine and wanted to do something with WebSocket
Since I also wanted to do something with evented I/O with
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/), why not make it super buzzwordy and combine
both!
